          A Booth ("Administrator," "I," "Me," "My") operates this
          self-hosted, personal instance of the Postiz application (the
          "Application"), accessible via https://postiz.hirea.app. This Privacy
          Policy describes how I collect, use, and safeguard the personal
          information of Users of this Application.

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">1. Scope of This Policy & Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies solely to this privately hosted instance
          of the Application, which is intended for the personal,
          non-commercial use of the Administrator and a limited number of
          invited personal friends. It is not a public service. I am
          committed to protecting your privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">2. Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>I collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong> To use the Application, you
            will provide basic information such as a username, email address,
            and password to create an account. This is collected directly by
            the Administrator or through the Application's registration
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content You Provide:</strong> Any User-Generated Content
            (text, images, videos, posts, comments, messages) that you
            create, upload, schedule, or manage through the Application for
            posting to your connected Social Networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Network Data:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>
                When you connect your Social Network accounts (e.g., YouTube,
                Facebook, X, Instagram) to the Application, I will collect
                authentication tokens or API keys necessary to interact with
                those services on your behalf.
              </li>
              <li>
                Depending on the permissions you grant and the features you
                use, the Application may access profile information, posts,
                analytics, and other data from your connected Social Network
                accounts, as permitted by the respective Social Network's API
                and your settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                For Google/YouTube: If you connect your YouTube account, the
                Application will access data in accordance with the
                permissions you grant via Google's consent screen. This may
                include viewing your YouTube account, managing your videos,
                viewing your YouTube analytics, etc., solely for the purpose
                of enabling you to use the Application's features with
                YouTube. The Application's use of information received from
                Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data
                Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Log Data and Usage Information:</strong> The Application
            server may automatically record information ("Log Data") created
            by your use of the Application. Log Data may include information
            such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the
            referring web page, pages visited, location (if enabled), device
            information, and error messages. This data is used for
            troubleshooting, maintaining the security and operational
            integrity of this personal instance, and understanding usage
            patterns solely for improving this instance for its limited users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">3. How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          I use the information collected solely for the following purposes:
        </p>

            <strong>To Improve This Instance:</strong> To understand how this
            specific instance is being used by my personal friends and me, to

            unauthorized access or fraudulent activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations (if any):</strong> If
            required by law in the United Kingdom, though this is highly
            unlikely for a personal instance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I DO NOT use your personal information for:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>Commercial advertising or marketing.</li>
          <li>Selling, renting, or leasing to third parties.</li>
          <li>
            Profiling for any purpose other than providing the core
            functionality of this Application to you and my invited friends.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          I do not share your personal information with third parties, except
          in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>With Connected Social Networks:</strong> When you authorize
            the Application to connect to your Social Network accounts,
            information will be shared with those services as necessary to
            provide the Application's functionality (e.g., posting your
            content). Your data is then subject to that Social Network's
            privacy policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google/YouTube:</strong> Information shared with YouTube via
            the API is governed by the Google Privacy Policy
            (https://policies.google.com/privacy).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For Legal Reasons (Highly Unlikely):</strong> If I believe
            in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal
            obligation in [Your Jurisdiction], protect my rights or safety, or
            the rights or safety of others, or to investigate fraud. This
            would only occur under very specific and rare legal compulsion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Providers for Hosting:</strong> The server on which
            this Application is hosted may be provided by a third-party
            hosting company. This company would only process data as
            instructed by me for the purpose of hosting the Application and
            would be subject to confidentiality agreements. I am the sole
            administrator with direct access to the Application data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No other users of this personal instance (other than the
          Administrator) have access to your specific authentication tokens for
          Social Networks.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can typically access and
            update your account information through the Application's settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can request the deletion of your
            account and associated personal data stored within this
            Application by contacting the Administrator at
            boothcamre@gmail.com. I will delete your data from this personal
            instance. Please note that content already published to Social
            Networks must be deleted directly from those platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Revoking Access to Social Networks:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>
                You can disconnect your Social Network accounts from the
                Application through its settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                For Google/YouTube: You can revoke the Application's access to
                your YouTube data at any time via the Google security settings
                page:
                https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.
                Upon revocation or your deletion request, I will ensure
                deletion of Google user data retrieved by the Application, as
                required by Google's policies.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          I take reasonable measures to protect the information collected from
          loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes
          using secure protocols (like HTTPS if configured), password
          protection for accounts, and limiting access to the Application's
          backend to the Administrator only. However, no internet-based
          service is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          I will retain your personal information for as long as your account
          is active on this personal instance or as needed to provide you with
          the Application's functionalities. If you request account deletion,
          I will delete your information as described in Section 5. Log data
          may be retained for a limited period for security and operational
          analysis.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          This Application is not intended for use by individuals under the
          age of 13 (or a higher age if stipulated by [Your Jurisdiction]). I
          do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">9. Third-Party Links & Social Network Policies</h2>
        <p>
          The Application allows connection to Third-Party Platforms (Social
          Networks). This Privacy Policy only applies to this specific
          instance of the Postiz Application. Once you connect to or your
          content is posted to a Social Network, its privacy policy and terms
          govern your data on that platform.

          after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy
          Policy.
